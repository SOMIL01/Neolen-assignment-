# Neolen-assignment-

The path of the text file has to be replaced in the third cell of the nootebook 

Brief Description about the assignment :
1. I used langchain to create the AI agent and used Open AI's embeddings and LLM (large language model )
2. The code is written in python
3. Chroma db is used to store vectors (We could have used pinecone to store on cloud ; this would help us to retrieve it anytime and save  computation )4. RetrievalQAChain was used because it uses Retriever and QA chain to retrieve the document and answer the questions.
